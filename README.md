## 🎨 About the Project

This game was created as a submission for the Rouleur Discord Art Competition, celebrating the return of the server and the launch of the **Rouleur Collection**.

> “Create a piece of art based on the collection. It can be anything — a painting, a movie, an object, a dance… literally anything that could be considered art.”

This interactive artwork is a **2D bike racing game** built in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), combining pixel art, animation, and sound design to evoke the energy and motion of a grand tour cycling sprint. Every asset, from the pixel graphics to the background animation, was **hand-drawn and coded without the use of AI**.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- Race through an abstract road course inspired by vintage cycling tours.
- Compete against AI opponents and aim for the finish line.
- Explore the in-game gallery showcasing pieces from the Rouleur collection.
